Once upon a time there was a mountain on which stood a temple. 
There was a little monk in the temple. 
The little monk went down to fetch water every day. 
Every time he came down the hill, he met a lady who would sing to him.
What was she singing about?
She was in fact singing about the coconut she had lost long ago.
You see, she was very attached to this coconut. It had a face and could talk.
She longed to be reunited with her coconut.
One day, the little monk decided to set out to find the coconut.
He felt attached to the singing woman, and wanted to make her soul feel complete.
The little monk, for the first time in years, went past the mountain.
He walked into the village and looked for people to talk to.
The first place he went to was a marketplace.
It was full of vendors selling fruits, sweets, and fish.
