Once upon a time there was a mountain on which stood a temple. 
There was a little monk in the temple. 
The little monk went down to fetch water every day. 
Every time he came down the hill, he met a lady who would sing to him.
What was she singing about?
She was in fact singing about the coconut she had lost long ago.
You see, she was very attached to this coconut. It had a face and could talk.
She longed to be reunited with her coconut.
